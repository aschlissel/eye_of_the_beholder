For my final data science project at Metis, I wanted to make something that was creative, contributed to society, and that I was passionate about. I thought about what I like to do on the weekends, and one of my favorite things to do is to go to art museums, specifically, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC.

This is a recommender system I made for paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
